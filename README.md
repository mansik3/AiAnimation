## Apply an ML model to recognize hand gestures and use them to control behavior of an animated character
* Utilize Tensorflow keras to train a CNN model to recognize unique hand gestures from videos
* Update animated character in Blender to move based on the real-time predicted hand gesture

* Currently need more videos to properly train --> there are only sample videos here to show structure of data, not the full dataset
